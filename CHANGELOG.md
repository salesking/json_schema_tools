# Changelog JSON Schema Tools

##2015-03

* allow $refs to include plain schema file name
* add $schema version to each file

##2015-01

* add :reader option for Obj.as_schema_hash to use a custom reader instance(with its own schema registry), instead of the global one

##2014-12

* object.as_schema_hash converts values to types defined in the schema e.g  strings, integers
* Object.from_hash casts object(json) field values into their ruby type for string, integer, date, date-time


##2014-11

* add from_json method to attributes module, to create new objects from a json string
* remove as_json method(alias of as_schema_json) conflicting with active_resource/active_record. Nothing stops one from using/aliasing it in his own code.

##2014-10

* handle circular dependencies in $ref arguments, so schema.to_h always resolves $refs properly

##2014-09
